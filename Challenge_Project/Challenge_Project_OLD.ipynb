It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally, there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to **goiter**. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or cretinism.\n\nWorldwide, too little **iodine** in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition **Hashimoto's thyroiditis**. Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, and previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with **blood tests** measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.\n\nAbout one billion people around the world are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in nearly **5% of Americans over the age of 12**.\n\nAnd that is why we iodize salt.\n\n![thyroid-gland.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/thyroid-gland.png)","block_group":"00000-8b5d522d-fc03-43db-aaff-a40f052bec90"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OFF1-BLiSLZ8","colab_type":"text","cell_id":"3bdac64e60ad43fbadd51ddc626b8073","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"Doctors all around the world need our help to predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism. We have already **overspent** our budget to collect such comprehensive data on about 30 attributes for 2,800 patients—a good starting number, but a larger sample would certainly be preferred. Moving forward, however, we simply cannot afford to spend so much money on data collection. Therefore, we also need to determine **which attributes are the most meaningful** to the predictive models, and cut out the rest that don't contribute much.\n\nThe boss wants to see a **balanced** model that can predict with a **high sensitivity** and **high specificity** while using a ***low amount of features***. Collecting complete data such as this is very rare, very time-consuming, and often very expensive. By minimizing the number of features, we can optimize future data collection and decide what needs to be collected and what doesn't.","block_group":"00001-0e5a6dfa-b096-43d7-b48a-e2621857d4f4"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HsZB_SGvp4mP","colab_type":"text","cell_id":"f707d1837f3e41748854219f4e19c3e4","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"##

Specifically, the diagnostic performance of a test, or the accuracy of a test to discriminate diseased cases from normal cases, is evaluated using **Receiver Operating Characteristic** (ROC) curve analysis.\n\nWhen you consider the results of a particular test in two populations, one population with a disease and the other without the disease, you will rarely observe a perfect separation between the two groups. Hence, there exists an overlap as in the diagram below (which creates **false negatives** and **false positives**).\n\n![roc_overlap.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/roc_overlap.png)\n\nIn a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the **true positive rate** (sensitivity; $\\frac {TP} {TP+FN}$) is plotted against the **false positive rate** (1 - specificity; $\\frac {TN} {TN+FP}$) for different cutoff points. Each point on the ROC curve represents a TPR/FPR pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. A test with perfect discrimination (no overlap in the two distributions) has an ROC curve that passes through the upper left corner (100% TPR, 100% FPR). Therefore, the closer the ROC curve is to the *upper-left* corner, the higher the overall accuracy of the test.\n\n![tpr_vs_fpr.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/tpr_vs_fpr.png)","block_group":"00056-fdc3ef5e-8145-44a9-bb6a-3b892ca67fe1"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cvTWQTcycBEp","colab_type":"text","cell_id":"d5b43b57cf3d4b4ebaf9436c537e1c4f","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"Now, let's calculate the area under the ROC curve with your predictions.

The points are weighted and designed to equate to -1 in a Zero Rule baseline model. This point scheme is designed to punish you heavily for predicting false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN)—FN cases especially. In doing so, we hope you see the importance of **clinical considerations** and treat your models from a more **human perspective**, rather than be detached from it.\n- Similar to the confusion matrix, we want you to keep in mind the other aspects of healthcare analytics—in this case, **economic feasibility**. In essence, we want you to minimize the amount of time and money spent on data collection by reducing the number of features collected. Each record certainly required a lot of time and money from several individuals and businesses to reliably create, and we hope you gain a better understanding of conducting a useful cost-benefit analysis with this scoring method.
